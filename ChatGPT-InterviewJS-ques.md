``Value, Variables, Types, and Operators:``
`Data Types:`
1. Explain the difference between primitive data types and objects in JavaScript.
```js
Ans: 
- Primitive data types contain or hold only one Value at a time.
- There are 5 primitive data type:
- `number- 1,2,3,4;`
- `string- singlequote(''), doublequote(""), backticks(``) `
- `boolean- true & false`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- Object in JS means it is Non-Primitive data type which contain or hold one and more value at a time.
- Example:-{name:'Yatharth', sirName:'Giri'}...
```
2. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?
```js
- the primitive data types in JavaScript can hold one value at a time
` number,string,boolean,null,undefined `
```
3. How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?
```js
- the type of a variable is checked by typeof operator and it always return string data type.
```

``Data Structure (Objects and Arrays):``
